    "\n",
    "Our challenge is to build a multi-headed model thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate.  The toxic language data set is sourced from Wikipedia and available as a public kaggle data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use various machine learning techniques used in class to develop high quality ML models and pipelines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exercise and build upon concepts covered in class and test out at least 3 kinds of supervised models:\n",
    "    a. Regression (LASSO, Logistic)\n",
    "    b. Trees (RF, XGBoost)\n",
    "    c. DeepLearning (Tensorflow)\n",
    "2. Using stacking/ensembling methods for improving prediction metrics (K-Means, anomaly detection)\n",
    "3. Using unsupervised methods for feature engineering/selection\n",
    "\n",
    "For the baseline proposal, this file contains a first pass run through from data preprocessing to model evaluation using a regression model pipeline. \n",

    "In choosing a neural net model for text classification, the output layer should have the same number of nodes as the number of classification labels. In this case, there are 6 labels and as such not only will the output layer have 6 nodes, but the final hidden layer as well. The input layer will have the same number of nodes as features, normally, and ideally the initial hidden layer will be between that and the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're limiting our feature set to 5,000 principal components, and it was not possible to use a number of initial hidden layer nodes at all close to that, running this process on a Macbook. So, setting the initial hidden layer to 12 gave at least some benefit of being less than the number of features and greater than the number of output classes. This (12,6) model is the one that ended up producing best (most accurate) results.\n",
    "\n",
